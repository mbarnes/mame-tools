# mame-tools

Some simple scripts I use to build and compare different versions of
[MAME](http://mamedev.org/) to watch for any XML/CLI changes relevant to
front-end applications.

The scripts expect the full [MAME git repo](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/)
to be cloned to a directory named `mame`.  Working directories for specific
releases are named after the git tag, e.g. `mame0123`.
